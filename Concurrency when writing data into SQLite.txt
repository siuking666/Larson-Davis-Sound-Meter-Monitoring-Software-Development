Concurrency when writing data into SQLite

Here are my general tips regarding mattn's driver, which my team has used to build SQLite-backed microservices:

0. Set the journal mode to WAL and synchronous to Normal.

Use two connections, one read-only with max open connections set to some large number, and one read-write set to a maximum of 1 open connection.

Set the transaction locking mode to IMMEDIATE and use transactions for any multi-query methods.

Set the busy timeout to some large value, like 5000. I'm not sure why this is necessary, since I figured the pool size of 1 would obviate the need for this, but it seems necessary (otherwise you can get database is locked errors).

With these few settings, we get good performance for our use case (>2K mid-size writes/sec, 30K reads per second on 2 vCPU and an SSD). I'd also recommend using Litestream to perform WAL shipping to S3.
